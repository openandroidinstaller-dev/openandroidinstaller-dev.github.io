      <div class="content">
        <p>
          Most of the devices are tested with LineageOS (official and some unofficial releases) as well as LineageOS
          for MicroG or PixelExperience when available.
          But you can use the OpenAndroidInstaller to install all kinds of custom Android ROMs.
        </p>
        <h4>A selection of different Android-based ROMs and where to find them:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://wiki.lineageos.org/devices/" target="_blank">LineageOS</a></li>

              target="_blank">xda-developers

      <div class="content">
        <p>
          If your device is currently not supported, you have basically two options.
        </p>
        <h4>Contribute support for your device:</h4>
        <p>If you have some experience with flashing Android ROMs, you can find more details on how to contribute
          here: <a class="is-link" href="https://github.com/openandroidinstaller-dev/openandroidinstaller#contributing"
            target="_blank">How
            to
            contribute?</a></p>
        <h4>Ask for support:</h4>
        <p>You can also open a github issue and ask for support for your device. There might be reasons, that your
          device is not supported and likely will not get support.</p>

    <div class="notification has-background-white-bis p-6 content">
      <h3 id="which-addons" class="title is-3">What are addons and which ones are supported?</h3>
      <p>Addons are optional, additional apps and services that are useful to have. Most notable Google Apps and
        Services as well as MicroG to replace them or the F-Droid FOSS App-Store.</p>
      <br>
      <p>There are different packages of *Google Apps* available.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://wiki.lineageos.org/gapps#downloads" target="_blank">MindTheGapps</a></li>

      </ul>
      <p>You can find out more about MicroG here: <a href="https://microg.org/" target="_blank">MicroG</a>.
        The recommended way to install MicroG is to use the zip file provided here: <a

          target="_blank">FriendlyNeighborhoodShane/MinMicroG_releases</a>.

      <h3 id="can-i-use-gapps" class="title is-3">How can I use Google Apps for my device?</h3>
      <p>While we don't like google apps, some people feel that they need them to leverage the full experience of
        their Android devices.
        We believe people should be free to do what they want with their devices. So installing them is supported as
        well.
      </p>
      <p>It is still recommended to use ROMs with built-in Google Apps like PixelExperience.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="notification has-background-white-bis p-6 content">
      <h3 id="somethings-wrong" class="title is-3">What to do if something goes wrong?</h3>
      <p class="title is-5">Sometimes things will hang with showing "waiting-for-device" in the "Advanced output" view
        or fail to send the recovery or image to the device correctly.
      </p>
      <p>
        What you can do in this case:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Try a different USB-Cable</li>
        <li>Try a different USB-Port on your PC</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="title is-5">Sometimes the selected ROM image will not boot properly.
        Usually, in this case, the image is not suited for the specific device or is broken.
      </p>
      <p>
        What you can do in this case:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Make sure your device is supported by the image up to the exact device id.
        <li>Try a different image for your device. This is especially useful for unofficial images of ROMs.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Of course, there are other things that can go wrong. If non of the above helps, write an email or raise an
        issue on GitHub.

      <h3 id="unlock-bootloader" class="title is-3">Will this tool unlock my bootloader?</h3>
      <p>First of all, this tool will not help you bypass any vender locked bootloaders in non-official ways.</p>
      <p>Devices by <em>Samsung, Google, OnePlus, Fairphone</em> and others make it relatively easy to unlock the
        bootloader and get good support in the installer.</p>
      <p>For some devices, it is necessary to unlock the bootloader manually. You usually need to create an account on
        the manufacturer&#39;s website, wait for a certain time and obtain a code from there. OpenAndroidInstaller will
        try to guide you as far as possible. These vendors include <em>Sony, Motorola and Xiaomi</em> amongst others.
      </p>
      <p>Other phone manufacturers no longer allow you to unlock the bootloader. Nothing can be done if you have not
        unlocked your device in time. These manufacturers include <em>Huawei, Honor, LG and ASUS</em>. Support for these
        manufacturers will always be very limited.</p>

      <h3 id="is-it-virus" class="title is-3">Virus scanners show the tool as a virus or trojan. What is going on?
      </h3>
      <p>In some virus scanners the OpenAndroidInstaller shows up as a virus or trojan. This is a false positive. We
        explain the issue here.
        The code and build process of the distributed files is completely open source and can be found on github. So
        people can verify that it's not malicious software.
      </p>
      <p>The Installer is bundled and compiled python code made into an executable file. This is done with <a
          href="https://pyinstaller.org/" target="_blank">pyinstaller</a>.
        As it turns out, false positive issues are known and people encounter them regularly.</p>

      <p> It seems like sometimes fastboot (the tool used for flashing the recovery) doesn't work properly. A possible
        solution weirdly can be to try a different USB-cable and/or different USB-Ports.</p>

      </p>
      <p>If you are running the executable directly, the logs are located in the same directory as the executable.</p>
